## Good Design?

Q: Is it a good design if I have a backend for a game that has an admin database and per-game databases. my backend is written in nestjs and depending on the user logged in and the game that he wants to play, the backend will connect to the admin db and to the per-game db to retrieve his data

A: This architectural approach—using an admin database plus per-game databases and connecting to the relevant ones based on user and game context—can be sound for certain use cases, but it comes with important trade-offs and considerations.

### Advantages

- **Separation of Concerns:** An admin database can store global settings, user profiles, permissions, and meta information, while individual game databases isolate game-specific data such as progress, leaderboards, and content.
- **Scalability:** Per-game databases can be distributed and scaled independently, making it easier to manage performance as your player base grows, or as you add new games.
- **Security & Data Isolation:** Data leaks in one game don’t compromise others. This also simplifies GDPR/data compliance in regional releases.

### Challenges

- **Connection Overhead:** Dynamically switching between different databases per request increases complexity and potential for latency. Pooling and efficient connection management become crucial.
- **Operational Complexity:** Schema migrations, backups, monitoring, and updates have to be coordinated across multiple databases, which requires solid DevOps practices.
- **Consistency Issues:** Ensuring consistency between admin and per-game databases can be challenging, particularly for cross-game features (such as shared achievements).
- **Resource Management:** NestJS supports dynamic database connections via providers, but improper handling can lead to memory leaks or exhausted connection pools.

### Alternatives

- Using a **single multi-tenant database** with game and admin tables differentiated by partitioning keys can simplify management but increases data coupling.
- Implementing a **microservices architecture**, with each game managed by a separate service and database, can improve isolation and scalability but adds inter-service communication overhead.

### Recommendations

- This pattern is appropriate if your games are distinct enough (different teams, different schemas, or isolated player sets) and you have strong ops resources.
- For manageable numbers of games and players, consider optimizing connection pooling and schema version tracking.
- If you expect to scale to dozens of games, automate admin/ops workflows (migrations, monitoring) as early as possible.

This structure can be a good design in scenarios with high data isolation needs and potentially independent scaling of games, but it is not always the simplest or most maintainable solution for smaller-scale projects.

## how many collections

I desided to pick a single multi-tenant approach for my game. each tenant in my database is called a game with a gameId. Some objects are per game, for example a place, place connection, vehicles. Some other objects are per-game but also per-player. for example, vehicles owned by a player in a game, places discovered by a player for a game. I'm thinking of keeping all these instance entities that are per-player in a single mongo collection. What are the challenges and advantages with this approach and would a collection-per-entity approach be better/

Storing all per-player, per-game entities in a single MongoDB collection is a common, flexible approach but comes with specific trade-offs compared to using a collection-per-entity model[1][2].

### Advantages of a Single Collection for Per-Player Entities

- **Schema Flexibility:** MongoDB permits heterogeneous document structures in one collection, making it easy to store various per-player entity types and evolve those schemas over time[3][1].
- **Simplified Query Aggregation:** Aggregating data across entity types (for example, getting all data for a given player) is efficient and can be done with a single query, leveraging discriminators or type fields[1].
- **Indexing Efficiency:** With careful indexing on gameId, playerId, and entityType, queries can remain performant even with mixed entity types[1].
- **Reduced Operational Complexity:** Avoids the overhead of creating and managing numerous collections, which can otherwise become unwieldy at scale[1][2].
- **Easier scaling for tenants:** MongoDB’s auto-sharding works well with a few large collections rather than many small ones[4].

### Challenges of a Single Collection Approach

- **Index Management:** Different entity types may need specific indexes, leading to either unnecessary index bloat or less efficient queries for certain entities[1].
- **Sparse Documents:** Heterogeneity in document structure can result in large, sparse documents, impacting storage and query performance as unused fields populate documents across entity types[1].
- **Query Performance:** As the collection grows, unrelated documents could slow down some queries, especially if efficient indexing strategies are not maintained[1][3].
- **Data Complexity:** Managing and debugging mixed-entity documents requires rigorous discipline in tracking schemas and updating migration logic[1].
- **Document Size Limits:** Large arrays or embedding too much in a single document can run into MongoDB's document size limits (16MB), though this is usually only an issue for very rich or long-lived player histories[5].

### Collection-Per-Entity Model: When Is It Better?

- **Large, Homogeneous Datasets:** If per-entity datasets (like vehicles or places) are very large or have fundamentally different query/access patterns, separate collections can optimize indexes and queries for each type[1].
- **Operational Scale:** If the number of entities/types is modest and relatively fixed, managing multiple collections doesn’t introduce too much overhead and can simplify per-type aggregation, validation, and maintenance[6].
- **Clearer Data Separation:** Development and debugging can be easier with one schema per collection, and updating schema for one entity does not affect others.

### MongoDB Community Best Practice

- Most experts favor fewer, larger collections rather than one collection per entity or tenant, citing sharding efficiency, index management, and hardware utilization[7][1].
- For games, it is common to store all per-player data in a “playerData” collection with fields for gameId, playerId, entityType, and appropriate subdocuments for each entity[5][8].

In summary, for most game backends, particularly where new entity types might arise or player-to-entity mappings are dynamic, a single well-indexed collection is typically the easier and more scalable solution[1][4][3]. Just be sure to monitor index bloat, query performance, and clearly separate document schemas within the collection.
