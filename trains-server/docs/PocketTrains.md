# Pocket Trains

## Features

- Simple design, not a lot of customization
- Bux is the special currency, gold coins the normal one
- You can get bux by buying it with $$$ or by completing 'special' jobs
- Aim of game is to move cars from one start city to a destination city. On completion, you get coins or less likely bux
- Bigger aim of game is to cover the whole globe with lines (unlock all continents) and complete all achievements
- Each day there is a special task, get XXX cars of one type to one city, or get XXX cars from one city to their destination
- Can buy a subscription (once in a lifetime) that will refuel trains faster and unlock 10 (instead of 5) slots per station upgrade

### Map

- Static map with static connections
- Start with a line from a city, can buy lines connected to your graph then assign them to your railroad.
- Each railroad has a color. Funnily you can color 2 railroads same color and connect them and you don't know which one is which. 
- One train, one railroad. No shared connections. To change a connection to another railroad, you pay coin
- Each connection has a length. Train circulates a connection, uses an amount of fuel and get to destination in a fix amount of minutes. 
- After circulation a connection, amount of fuel is decreased. Fuel of a train regenerates slowly or you can pay bux to fill it up.

### Trains

- Trains have
  - Max distance
  - Max fuel
  - Consume fuel per time?
  - Fixed speed
  - Fuel cars
  - Max number of slots per engine
  - Depending on train type, can have a max number of engines and fuel cars
- Trains are formed by combining parts
- Parts are discovered in crates. Opening a crate uses bux.
- What parts you discover depends on your level.
- Crates can also be 'picked up' while watching the train run (they scroll across the screen) or are sometimes available for purchase in stations.
- You can exchange parts with other users using some code
- You start up with slow trains that allow only 1 engine and 1 fuel car and can tug 8 cars
- You graduate to average trains that can either take 2 engine or 2 fuel cars or both, 12-14 cars per train
- Advance trains, 16-18 cars per train
- Endgame trains, freighters, up to 28 cars or super-fast trains 24 cars
- Special trains, available on holidays, tradeoff of some kind, either slow but 20 cars, or 13/14 cars but no fuel car etc.... They are available early but they need constant refueling

### Jobs

- Jobs are generated randomly when a train arrives in a station
- When 2 trains are in same station, jobs are different for each one
- Job sizes are 1-5 cars
- Jobs are shades of gray depending on payout per car
- Jobs to be delivered to a station on same railroad are colored differently
- Trains can unload cars/jobs in a station
- Acquired job cars left in a station have a different header and persist
- Stations have a limited amount of space for cars, more can be acquired with bux
- Hard to unload all cars from a train, as the loaded jobs are sprinkled within the available and stored jobs
- Some stations thus become hubs with hundreds of jobs stored in them
- The way jobs are structured, in time different 'channels' form up across continent longitudinally or latitudinally; splitting stations into either feeders or hubs. 

## Pocket Planes

Same idea with a few differences
- Connections are not fixed, but based on an airplane's range. As long as an airplane has the range, it can go whereever it wants
- Jobs are not full cars but either passengers or freight.
- Planes are either freight only, passenger only or a mix-up.
- More social features, like completing mass-tasks together with all players, advertising some
